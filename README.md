# How To Play:
                                                                                                        
###           You'll receive a random list of targets,                                                                                       
###           every target has it's own number(integer).                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                          
#           There are three options:                                                                                                       
#             Shoot {Target} {Power}: Shooting the target's number with the chosen power.                                                    
             Example: Shoot 1 200                                                                                                           
             If 200 is smaller or equal to the first's target number, your target will be reduced by the power.                            
             If 200 is bigger than your target with 5 or more, the power is too much and you'll miss the shot.                              
             If the target's value it's between -5 and 0, the target will be removed.                                                       
###          Sometimes, while you're playing there's a chance for the game to add a target.                                                
#           Second option, Strike {Target} {Radius}: You'll directly remove the target, and all the targets in the chosen radius.       
###             Example: Strike 4 2                                                                                                           
             Removes the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th target, because 4th target is your chosen target, and 2 is your chosen radius.          
                                                                                                                                          
                               BE CAREFUL! At some point the game will decide to say End and the game ends!                                
                                      The game is considered won if there aren't any targets                                              
                            At the end of the game will be printed a list of the left targets value                                       
                                           You can also End the game by typing End
